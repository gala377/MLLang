; we can have scope blocks with lambdas :)
fn scope s = s!

val a = 1
scope:
  val a = 10
  print "Hello"
  print "How are you?"

print (toString a)

val b = scope:
  val a = 10

print b

; works in functions
fn useScope:
  val a = 10
  scope:
    a = 0
    val c = 1
  print a
  ; print c - runtime error, c undefined
useScope!

; btw last example can be rewritten
scope:
  val a = 20
  scope:
    a = 0
    val c = 1
  print a

val beg = scope
val end = b ; equals to None

; who wants some pascal?
beg:
  print 1
  print 2
  print 3
end
